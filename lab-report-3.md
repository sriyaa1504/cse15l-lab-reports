EXAMPLE 1 
Command: 
[cs15lwi23ain@ieng6-202]:skill-demo1-data:400$ grep -r "Hello" .

Output:
./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/CH4.txt:Children’s earliest efforts at make-believe also reveal how challenging they ﬁnd the task of detaching thought from reality. Initially, object substitutions are closely tied to the real things they represent. Toddlers between ages 1 1/2 and 2 generally use only realistic-looking objects while pretending—a toy telephone to talk into or a cup to drink from.9 Once, I handed a 21-month-old a small wooden block, put another to my ear, and called her on the phone: “Ring! Ring! Hello, Lynnay!” She responded by throwing down the block and turning to another activity. Yet when given a plastic replica of a push-button phone, Lynnay readily put the receiver to her ear and pretended to converse.
./written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/CH4.txt:As children engage in play talk, they not only build their vocabularies but correct one another’s errors, either directly or by demonstrating the acceptable way to speak. In one instance, a kindergartner enacting a telephone conversation said, “Hello, come to my house, please.” Her play partner quickly countered with appropriate telephone greeting behavior: “No, ﬁrst you’ve got to say ‘How are you? What are you doing?’”28
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToFrance.txt:        Saint-Wandrille, Le Bec-Hellouin, and Caen, culminating in their
```
- This command uses `-r` to recursively search through all the files in the directory.
- It returns all occurences of the word "Hello".
- It is beneficial when we want to search for a specific word in all the files present.

```
EXAMPLE 2
Command: 
[cs15lwi23ain@ieng6-202]:skill-demo1-data:401$ grep -r --exclude-dir=non-fiction "Hello" .

Output:
./written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToFrance.txt:        Saint-Wandrille, Le Bec-Hellouin, and Caen, culminating in their
```
- This command uses `--exclude-dir=` to exclude a directory while searching for a pattern.
- The `.` searches through all the files present.
- This command can be useful when there a lot of directories and we want to ignore only a specific one.


> COMMAND 2 `-c`

**SOURCE: ChatGPT**

```
EXAMPLE 1
Command:
[cs15lwi23ain@ieng6-202]:Berk:411$ grep -c "Hello" CH4.txt

Output:
2
```
- This command uses `-c` to count the number of occurrences of a pattern in a file.
- This can be useful when the file is huge.

```
EXAMPLE 2
Command:
[cs15lwi23ain@ieng6-202]:Berk:412$ grep -v -c "Hello" CH4.txt

Output:
311
```
- This command uses `-v` to count the number of lines in a file that do not match a pattern.
- It helps when there are many lines in a file and the pattern occurs only a few times.


> COMMAND 3 `-i`

**SOURCE: ChatGPT**

```
EXAMPLE 1
Command:
[cs15lwi23ain@ieng6-203]:Berk:390$ grep -i "hello" CH4.txt

Output:

```
- The `-i` command allows you to perform a case-insensitive search for a pattern in a file.
- This is useful when the word is present in both uppercase and lowercase.

```
EXAMPLE 2
Command:
[cs15lwi23ain@ieng6-202]:Berk:413$ grep -i "hello" ch2.txt ch7.txt ch1.txt

Output:

```
- The `-i` command can also be performed on multiple files at once which saves time and labor.
- Since there are no occurences of "hello" in any of those files, the output is empty.

> COMMAND 4 `-A`

EXAMPLE 1
Command: [cs15lwi23ain@ieng6-202]:Berk:414$ grep -A 1 "Hello" CH4.txt

Output:

Around age 2, children begin to pretend with less realistic toys, such as a block for a telephone. And sometime during the third year, they can imagine objects and events with little or no support from the real world, as when they say to a play partner, “I’m calling Susie on the phone!” while dialing with their hands or without acting out the event at all. Between ages 3 and 4, this detachment of make-believe symbols from the real-life conditions they stand for is well developed. Let’s look in on 4-year-old Alison as she draws her father into a make-believe scenario. Notice how Alison’s imagination ranges far beyond the immediate play props before her—a tea set, a toy truck, and an ambulance. In the span of a few moments, she conjures up a fantastic, multicolored house and room and travels to a distant land where she witnesses a cataclysmic event!
```
- The `-A` command allows you to print the specified number of lines after each match
- The paramaters are as follows
    - `1`:  number of lines you want to print after each match
    - `"Hello"`: the pattern
    - `CH4.txt`: the file
- It can be a useful tool for quickly finding and understanding the occurrences of a pattern in a file.

```
EXAMPLE 2
Command:
[cs15lwi23ain@ieng6-202]:Berk:413$ grep -n -A 1 "Hello" CH4.txt

Output:

- This command has `-n` in addition to `-A`.
- It is used to print the line number of each match.
- This is useful to easily find the location of the pattern in the file.
