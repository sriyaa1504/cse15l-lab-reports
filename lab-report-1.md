> 2. Remotely Connecting

- The next step in this lab is how to use VScode/terminal to connect to a remote computer over the Internet to do work there
- If you're on windows : 
  - install git for Windows
  - Then, to use ssh, open a terminal in VScode
  - Since this is likely the first time youâ€™ve connected to this server, you will probably get a message like this:
  - type yes and press enter, then give your password
  - Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any commands you run will run on that computer! 
  - We call your computer the client and the computer in the basement the server based on how you are connected
