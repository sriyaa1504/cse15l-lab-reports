`To create a fork of the repository, I went to the repository on github and clicked on the 'fork' button.
Since I already have a fork it shows it under 'existing forks'.

Then, to clone it I had to use the copy button on github and the 'git clone' command.`

`The javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java command was 3 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it. 
Then the java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore command was 3 up in the history, so I accessed and ran it in the same way.`
